A plugin for [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) that renders the dependencies of a given python project into a [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh) formula.

This project was inspired by [poetry-brew](https://pypi.org/project/poetry-brew/) that aims to solve the same problem but with a different approach.

## Setup

* If you installed poetry via [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) (preferred):

    ```bash
    pipx inject poetry poetry-homebrew-formula
    ```

* If you installed poetry a different way, most likely this will work, too:

    ```bash
    poetry self add poetry-homebrew-formula
    ```

    Please consult the [poetry docs on using plugins](https://python-poetry.org/docs/plugins/#using-plugins) for more details.

## Usage

Run `poetry homebrew-formula --help` for details on how to use it:
